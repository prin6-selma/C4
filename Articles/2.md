# Legalising the Recreational Use of Marijuana Will Have a Beneficial Impact on a Country's Economy

**By Dean Van Zyl**  
*October 13, 2023*

By the year 2022, the sale of marijuana had generated more than 3 billion dollars in annual tax revenue, making a substantial contribution to the economy of the United States of America (USA) ([Ramos, 2022](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/recreational-marijuana-sales-showered-states-cash-2021-n1287861)). In this context, recreational marijuana refers to the usage of marijuana for enjoyment as opposed to medicinal purposes ([Robinson, 2022](https://acquiesce.org.uk/differences-between-recreational-weed-and-medicinal-marijuana/#:~:text=Recreational%20weed%20refers%20to%20cannabis,of%20happiness%2C%20relaxation%20and%20sleepiness)). The recent trend of countries revising their laws to permit both medical and recreational marijuana use has caused considerable controversy and discussion ([ProCon.org, 2023](https://marijuana.procon.org/history-of-recreational-marijuana/)). The purpose of this essay is to conduct an analysis of the potential economic benefits that a country may experience because of the legalisation of recreational marijuana.

## Tax Revenue

The sale of marijuana can potentially be a significant contributor to a country's economy. It has been observed that the legalisation of marijuana can yield substantial tax revenue. As an example, in 2021, Washington and Colorado generated $559.5 million and $423 million, respectively, in tax revenue from marijuana sales ([Krishna, 2023](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/110916/economic-benefits-legalizing-weed.asp#:~:text=New%20Frontier's%20report%20predicting%20the,spring%20up%20across%20the%20nation)). Additionally, the total revenue generated from recreational marijuana sales was reported to be $15.16 billion in 2022 ([Daly, 2023](https://www.fool.com/research/marijuana-tax-revenue-by-state/)).

According to estimates, the implementation of a 15% federal sales tax would generate a total tax income of about $46 billion from 2017 to 2025 ([Song, 2018](https://newfrontierdata.com/cannabis-insights/cannabis-taxes-generate-106-billion-create-1-million-jobs-2025/)). Furthermore, through the combination of business tax revenues, payroll withholdings based on the employment required to sustain the industry, and a 15% retail sales tax, the full federal tax revenue potential of legalisation can be determined. This comprehensive total is projected to reach $105.6 billion.

## Job Creation

The legalisation of marijuana has the potential to significantly boost job creation, thereby providing a much-needed boost to the economy. While unemployment rates vary significantly between countries, the global unemployment figure is projected to reach 208 million people in 2023, with an average unemployment rate of 5.8% ([Ventura, 2023](https://www.gfmag.com/global-data/economic-data/worlds-unemployment-rates#:~:text=Young%20people%20between%2015%20and,an%20unemployment%20rate%20of%205.8%25)). However, in some countries, such as South Africa, the unemployment rate can be as high as 35.6%.

The marijuana industry has shown consistent job growth over the past five years. In 2021 alone, over 100,000 jobs were created, representing a 33% increase from the previous year ([Herrington, 2022](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajherrington/2022/02/23/new-cannabis-jobs-report-reveals-marijuana-industrys-explosive-employment-growth/?sh=5a1e75b423f2)). This growth rate has remained at or above 27% annually for the past five years, indicating a strong and sustainable trend in the industry. A report by New Frontier has projected that the legalisation of marijuana at the federal level could create up to one million jobs by the year 2025 ([Song, 2018](https://newfrontierdata.com/cannabis-insights/cannabis-taxes-generate-106-billion-create-1-million-jobs-2025/)).

## Reduction in Law Enforcement Expenditures

The legalisation of marijuana could lead to a reduction in law enforcement expenditures. In 2010 alone, $3.6 billion was spent on marijuana possession laws in the USA ([Bradford, 2013](https://www.cnbc.com/id/100791442)). According to projections, over the following six years, $20 billion will be allocated towards enforcing marijuana laws. In 2018, there were 663,000 arrests in the US related to marijuana, with 608,000 of those being solely for marijuana possession ([Jorgensen, 2020](https://www.boisestate.edu/bluereview/how-marijuana-legalization-would-benefit-the-criminal-justice-system/)). Housing inmates can cost anywhere from $30,000 to $35,000 per year, while marijuana user arrests can cost between $1,000 and $5,000 each.

## Boost to Tourism

The legalisation of marijuana has the potential to give a boost to the tourism industry. A study conducted between 2011 and 2015 revealed that Colorado's tourism industry saw a rental increase of 51,000 hotel rooms. Following the legalisation of recreational marijuana, the number of hotel rooms occupied per month skyrocketed to an additional 120,000 ([Drift Travel, 2023](https://drifttravel.com/legal-marijuana-and-its-impact-on-tourism/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20studies%20made,the%20use%20of%20recreational%20marijuana)). This exponential increase in tourism stimulated by the marijuana industry has the potential to foster growth in other sectors. According to an article by Slate, tourists spend four times more on marijuana products compared to the average customer ([Slate, 2022](https://www.tourism-review.com/cannabis-tourism-is-developing-fast-in-the-us-news12581)).

## Investment Opportunities

Legalising marijuana holds promise for generating substantial economic advantages on both a local and national scale, including enticing investment prospects ([Krishna, 2023](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/110916/economic-benefits-legalizing-weed.asp#:~:text=New%20Frontier's%20report%20predicting%20the,spring%20up%20across%20the%20nation)). These investment opportunities within the marijuana sector are diverse, ranging from established businesses involved in cultivation, distribution, and retail, to startups focused on cannabis technology and ancillary services ([NDWENION, 2021](https://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/is-green-the-new-gold-investment-opportunities-in-south-africas-cannabis-industry/98065/)). However, there is a lack of conclusive data on the economic benefits of marijuana investments.

## Impact on Neighboring Countries and Drug Trafficking

The legalisation of marijuana might have a negative impact on countries where marijuana is still classified as an illegal substance. Law enforcement officers in Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming report increased enforcement duties due to marijuana legalisation in Colorado ([Ward, et al., 2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1098611118783984)). However, the legalisation of marijuana has resulted in a decrease in drug trafficking, as the black-market price for marijuana has decreased by 20-30% ([Lindsey, 2017](https://greenrushdaily.com/news/legalization/long-term-effects-countries-legalized-cannabis/)).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the potential economic benefits of legalising recreational marijuana are substantial, including increased tax revenue, job opportunities, and reduced law enforcement costs. States like Washington and Colorado have already demonstrated the revenue-generating potential of the marijuana industry. However, there are differing opinions on how legalisation may affect neighboring countries and drug trafficking. While the focus of this essay has been on economic implications, further research is necessary to assess the social, health, and legal aspects of legalisation.
