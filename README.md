# Progress Notes

## 20/09/2024
### Website Development - Article Block Generation

- **Feature Implementation:**
  - Added functionality to generate article blocks from Markdown (.md) files.
  - The `.json` files store the article content, including author information.
  - Loops through the `.json` data and creates an article block for each entry.
  
- **Template & Display:**
  - Implemented an HTML article template to display specific articles.
  - Currently, only the first part of each article is displayed.
  - Full article display still needs to be implemented.
  
- **Styling & Enhancements:**
  - Article display requires further CSS styling for proper layout and formatting.
  - Plan to add the display of the author's name and publication date.
  
- **Potential Improvements:**
  - Consider updating the article-fetching method to retrieve data dynamically, rather than passing information through the URL.
